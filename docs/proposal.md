# Project Proposal

## Title
IoT-Based Intelligent Urban Waste Segregation System

## Background
Improper waste management causes environmental damage and inefficient recycling processes. Automation using IoT can significantly improve waste classification.

## Methodology
- User detection using proximity sensor.
- Lid control using servo motor.
- Waste detection using IR sensor.
- Wet/dry classification using rain sensor.
- Mechanical redirection using stepper motor.

## Expected Outcome
A working smart waste bin prototype capable of automatically segregating waste.
