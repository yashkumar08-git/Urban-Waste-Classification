# Urban Waste Classification – IoT Based Intelligent System

## 1. Introduction
Urban waste management is a major environmental challenge. Improper waste segregation leads to pollution, inefficient recycling, and increased landfill waste. This project aims to develop an IoT-based intelligent waste segregation system using Arduino and sensors.

## 2. Problem Statement
In many urban areas, waste is not properly segregated into wet and dry categories. Manual segregation is time-consuming and prone to human error. An automated smart system is required to improve efficiency and sustainability.

## 3. Objectives
- To design a smart waste bin using Arduino.
- To automatically detect and classify wet and dry waste.
- To reduce manual effort in waste segregation.
- To build a foundation for future sustainability monitoring.

## 4. Proposed System
The system will:
1. Detect user presence using a proximity sensor.
2. Open the lid using a servo motor.
3. Detect waste insertion using an IR sensor.
4. Identify wet or dry waste using a rain sensor.
5. Redirect waste using a stepper motor mechanism.
